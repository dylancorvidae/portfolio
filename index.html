          <h3>Basic Ass Maze Race</h3> 
            <h4>Description:</h4>
              <p>A SPA multiplayer game built using Socket.io, React, and p5 that allows players to invite up to eight friends to a private lobby and race against each other to see who can solve a randomly generated maze the fastest. Built by a team of 4 in 6 days.</p>
            <h4>My Role:</h4>
              <p>As UI & UX design lead I shaped how our game looked and was experienced by the end-users. I built accessibility into this game for people who live with different types of color blindness and it meets the WCAG standards for contrast and color. I utilized Coblis, a color blindness simulator, to test my color palettes and screenshots of the game throughout the production. In addition to UI & UX I wrote all of the CSS, a large portion of the HTML, built some of the React components, and wrote some of the tests. I wrote and organized the supporting docs that our group worked off as we built our app.</p>

          <h3>BASHful: A Terminal Based Dating Simulator</h3>
          <h4>Description:</h4>  
          <p>A CLI based date simulation app utilizing node.js, express, inquirer, mongodb, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, superagent, morgan, jest, chalk-pipe, and more. Built by a team of 5 in 5 days.</p>
          <h4>My Role:</h4>
          <p>I was lead on UX for this project and responsible for writing all the played content of the game. Most dating simulator games are not queer friendly and I made our game open to all gender identities and orientations. I built some of the mongoose schemas & models, wrote some of the tests and routes, created the music, and participated in mob & pair coding game logic.</p>

            <h4>My Role:</h4>
              <p>I shared the role of UI designer with a teammate on this project and was responsible for most of the UX as I wrote the content in the quiz and the personality assessments. In addition to content creation I coded the authorization and authentication on the signin/signup page. I was responsible for making the page fully responsive. I wrote most of the CSS and HTML, and built a majority of the javascript components. I wrote and organized the supporting docs that our group worked off as we built our app.</p>

          <h4>My Role:</h4>
          <p>This was my first group coding project and I did a little bit of everything. I participated in mob & pair programming the game logic. I worked on the UI and UX, coded a large portion of the CSS and HTML, and was responsible for the sound design and coding of the sound interactions.</p>
